**Project Description**

In this project, I gathered rideshare data between Uber and Lyft within the city of Boston, and presented the findings on a visualization dashboard.

**Data Source:**

1) Dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices

2) Google trends search data for Uber and Lyft

**The Steps:**

- Source data (Kaggle & the Google Trends UI)

- Create a BigQuery dataset and associated tables

- Query data using SQL/BQ API

- Push finalized CSV to Google Drive

- Connect to CSVs using Tableau

- Analysis

- Visualization

**Findings:**

Within the city of Boston, Uber generally ranks higher in popularity compared to Lyft. However, Lyft users will be able to experience cheaper fares for basic-level rides. Lyft should continue to market their cheaper basic-level rides, especially in university destinations, to remain competitive in the market with Uber.
